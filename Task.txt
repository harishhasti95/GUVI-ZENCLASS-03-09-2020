Differences between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP2:
1) Http 1.1 sends the data sequentially, but Http 2 sends all at once.
2) Multi plexing - HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource. HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.
3) Http 2 uses HPACK type of advanced compression to compress the request message.
